## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Flutter Templates Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templatesblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <dev@nimblehq.co>.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Get to know Mason

The Flutter templates use [Mason](https://github.com/felangel/mason) as the primary tool for generating a new Flutter project. Take some time to become familiar with it.

### Flutter templates structure

The repository contains three main files/directories:
- The `bricks` directory contains the primary development, which is the "template" brick.
- The `sample` directory contains a sample Flutter project that was automatically generated by the CI workflow. This ensures that the project is not broken during development.
- The `mason.yaml` file lists all the bricks in the repository.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/discussions/new?category=q-a).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide the project version and platform info (OS, Flutter version, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then analyze and plan for it.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side, e.g., using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [README](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type+%3A+bug%22+).
- Also, make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Flutter's doctor (if the generated project runs failed)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <dev@nimblehq.co>.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open a [Bug Report's Issue](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type+%3A+bug&projects=&template=bug_template.md&title=Fix%3A+).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports, you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Your First Code Contribution

If you're not sure where to start contributing to Flutter Templates, browse through the [Issues](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/issues) and choose one that suits you best.

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- Follow the [Flutter convention & style guides](https://nimblehq.co/compass/development/code-conventions/flutter/).
- After submitting your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
