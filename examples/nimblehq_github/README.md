# Flutter Templates

All the templates that can be used to kick off a new Flutter application quickly.

## Usage

Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:nimblehq/nimblehq_github.git`

## Prerequisite

- Flutter 2.2
- Flutter version manager (recommend): [fvm](https://fvm.app/)

## Getting Started

### Setup

- Create these `.env` files in the root directory according to the flavors and add the required
  environment variables into them. The example environment variable is in `.env.sample`.

  - Staging: `.env.staging`

  - Production: `.env`

- Run code generator

  - `$ fvm flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

### Run

- Run the app with the desire app flavor:

  - Staging: `$ fvm flutter run --flavor staging`

  - Production: `$ fvm flutter run --flavor production`

### Test

- Run unit testing:

  - `$ fvm flutter test .`

- Run integration testing:

  - `$ fvm flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/{test_file}.dart --flavor staging`

  - For example:

    `$ fvm flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/my_home_page_test.dart --flavor staging`

## Use the template

### Setup a new project

- To set up a new project from the template, run the command:

  - `$ make run PACKAGE_NAME={com.your.package} PROJECT_NAME={your_project_name} APP_NAME="{Your App Name}"`

  - Then clean the project: `$ fvm flutter clean`

  - Re-fetch the project: `$ fvm flutter pub get`

- Parameters detail:

  | Parameter name | Is mandatory | Description                                                                     |
  | :------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | PACKAGE_NAME   |     Yes      | The application package name. The naming convention follows `com.your.package`  |
  | PROJECT_NAME   |     Yes      | The application project name. The naming convention follows `your_project_name` |
  | APP_NAME       |     Yes      | The application name.                                                           |
  | APP_VERSION    |      No      | The app version that is set when initialize the project. Default is `0.1.0`     |
  | BUILD_NUMBER   |      No      | The build number that is set when initialize the project. Default is `1`        |

- For more supporting commands, run:

  - `$ make`

  - Or `$ make help`

### Maintain the template

- While implementing a new feature or fixing an issue, there may be a chance to break the functions of `setup.py` script due to the change in the codebase (update the app name, the package directory, etc.).

- To make sure that the `setup.py` script is still working correctly, run the command:

  - `$ make test`
