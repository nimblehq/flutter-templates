## Use the template

### Setup a new project

- To set up a new project from the template, run the command:

  - `$ make run PACKAGE_NAME={com.your.package} PROJECT_NAME={your_project_name} APP_NAME="{Your App Name}"`

  - Then clean the project: `$ fvm flutter clean`

  - Re-fetch the project: `$ fvm flutter pub get`

- Parameters detail:

  | Parameter name | Is mandatory | Description                                                                     |
  | :------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | PACKAGE_NAME   |     Yes      | The application package name. The naming convention follows `com.your.package`  |
  | PROJECT_NAME   |     Yes      | The application project name. The naming convention follows `your_project_name` |
  | APP_NAME       |     Yes      | The application name.                                                           |

  More available configs [here](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/wiki/Generating-A-Project)

- For more supporting commands, run:

  - `$ make`

  - Or `$ make help`

### Maintain the template

- While implementing a new feature or fixing an issue, there may be a chance to break the functions of `setup.py` script due to the change in the codebase (update the app name, the package directory, etc.).

- To make sure that the `setup.py` script is still working correctly, run the command:

  - `$ make test`
