## Use the template

### Setup a new project

Before using the template, ensure that you have installed the following prerequisites on your system:

- Flutter 3.3.10
- [Mason CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli) 0.1.0-dev.44

Follow these steps to set up a new project from the template:

- Fetch all required bricks by running the command:

  `$ mason get`

- Generate the new project by running the following command:

  `$ mason make template`

  > You can find the detailed information on `make` command options and usage in the [Mason documentation](https://github.com/felangel/mason/tree/master/packages/mason_cli#overview).

- Once the project is generated at `/{project_name}`, please refer to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/nimblehq/flutter-templates/tree/develop/bricks/template/__brick__/%7B%7Bproject_name.snakeCase()%7D%7D#getting-started) documentation to make it ready for development.

That's it! You have now set up a new Flutter project using the template ðŸŽ‰
